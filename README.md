## üí§ Why Night Fade?

Studies show that blue light affects melatonin production, which may degrade your sleep quality. And for me, more importantly, I've gotten used to the warm tint as my own mental cue that it's time to sleep!

I made this app so that I could make the screen 100% warm past midnight, so that I feel compelled to sleep and not stay up :)

Night Fade lets you **gradually increase** the Night Shift warmth intensity at scheduled times throughout the night - perfect for those who want their screen to get progressively warmer as bedtime approaches.

## üöÄ Install (takes just a minute!)

### Download
1. Go to the [**Releases page**](https://github.com/theJayTea/NightFade/releases) and download `Night_Fade_v1.dmg`
2. Open the DMG file and **read the `Please Read This.rtf` file first!** (It contains important setup instructions)

### Why the extra setup instruction steps?
Since I'm an independent developer who can't spend the $99/year Apple Developer just for this free open-source app, you'll need to follow a quick one-time setup to bypass macOS's Gatekeeper warnings.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è More Info

### How it works
- **No background process!** Night Fade uses macOS's native scheduling system - the app doesn't need to run continuously
- **Works with System Settings** - Night Shift on/off timing is still controlled in System Settings as usual
- **Privacy first** - No tracking, no logging, no network requests, no elevated permissions/login password required
- **Lightweight** - Set your schedules and close the app; they'll persist using the built-in system scheduler :D

### Features
- Schedule multiple time points throughout the night
- Set different warmth intensities for each time
- Schedules persist even when the app is closed
- Clean, native macOS interface

### Credits
This project uses parts of [smudge/nightlight](https://github.com/smudge/nightlight) to help control Night Shift. Thank you for the foundation!
